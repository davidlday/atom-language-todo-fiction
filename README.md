## Recommended Packages

There's a great post on the Atom.io discussion forum about
[Using Atom for academic writing](https://discuss.atom.io/t/using-atom-for-academic-writing/19222)
that provides a nice little list of other Atom packages for use with
writing. I've selected a few here that I feel apply equally well to
writing fiction in YAML/Markdown using Atom.

* [advanced-open-file](https://atom.io/packages/advanced-open-file) to
  quickly create new files.
* [document-outline](https://atom.io/packages/document-outline) to
  display a hierarchical, interactive outline tree view for document
  markup.
* [editorconfig](https://atom.io/packages/editorconfig) to maintain
  consistent Markdown / YAML styles across editors.
* [linter-languagetool](https://atom.io/packages/linter-languagetool) for
  spell & grammar checking using LanguageTool (you'll need to install
  LanguageTool separately).
* [typewriter](https://atom.io/packages/typewriter) to center the
  text in the editor.
* [wordcount](https://atom.io/packages/wordcount) because you just
  need this as a writer.
* [wrap-with-anything](https://atom.io/packages/wrap-with-anything) to
  text selections instead of replacing them when certain characters are
  typed.
* [zen](https://atom.io/packages/Zen) for distraction free writing.
